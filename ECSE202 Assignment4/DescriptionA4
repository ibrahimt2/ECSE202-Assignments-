This program implements Assignment 3, but with a fully functional GUI allowing the user to control each aspect of the randomly
generated balls. It also uses a combobox to allow to user to run and sort the program with new parameters as desired. 

This also adds the ability for the user to pick up balls with the mouse and drop them again, change color, energy loss coefficient etc.
